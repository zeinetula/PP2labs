#Write a program able to play the "Guess the number" - game, where the number to be guessed is randomly chosen between 1 and 20. This is how it should work when run in a terminal:
#Hello! What is your name?
#KBTU
#
#Well, KBTU, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
#Take a guess.
#12
#
#Your guess is too low.
#Take a guess.
#16
#
#Your guess is too low.
#Take a guess.
#19
#
#Good job, KBTU! You guessed my number in 3 guesses!
